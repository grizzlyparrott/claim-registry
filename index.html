    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p>Each recorded item is a JSON record plus optional files, packaged with a manifest of SHA-256 hashes. Records are also appended to a JSONL log that forms a hash chain, so edits or deletions become obvious.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>What it is not</h2>
    <p>It is not a legal opinion, a timestamp authority, or a guarantee that a claim is true. It is a reproducible way to preserve what was observed and detect tampering after the fact.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>Repository</h2>
